This script converts coefficients for <m, k, n> algorithms to all permutations:

0,1,2: <m, k, n>
0,2,1: <m, n, k>
1,0,2: <k, m, n>
1,2,0: <k, n, m>
2,0,1: <n, m, k>
2,1,0: <n, k, m>

The usage is:
   python convert.py coeff_file m,k,n out_file s1,s2,s3

where

coeff_file is the name of the original coefficient file
m,k,n is the original algorithm dimensions
out_file is the name of the file in which to write the new coefficients
s1,s2,s3 is the permutation, e.g. 1,2,0 for the <k, n, m> algorithm
